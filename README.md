# Ionic Modbus app for Nabto Modbus IoT demo

This [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) based modbus app is an example of how to create apps using [Nabto](https://www.nabto.com/?p=4156) realtime remote access IoT platform to query modbus devices via a [gateway](https://github.com/nabto/modbus-demo-gateway) created for this specific purpose.

The app is created based upon the [Nabto starter app](https://github.com/nabto/ionic-starter-nabto) so if you want to adjust and build the app yourself, you should read and follow the instruction for that.

Otherwise the compiled app can be downloaded from Apple's appstore or Google play.
